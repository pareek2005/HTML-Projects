    <h1>All About Me</h1>
    <p>Hello, world! My name is Pareekshith. I live in Fremont, California. I love playing Clash Royale and quiz bowl. </p>

    <!--Remember the correct file path to the image.-->

    <p>Here is a picture of a really cute kitten. Because my page is really boring without a photo.</p>

    <img src="http://placekitten.com/200/300" alt="Cute kittens together." title="Cute kittens together.">

    <p>I love reading books as well, preferably classics by Jules Verne, Charles Dickens, and other great authors. I dislike romantic novels and new novels because they are a waste of time and don't contain a sense of fun and adventure. </p>
